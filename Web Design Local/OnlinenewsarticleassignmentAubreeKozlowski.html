Authorities responded to a 911 call around 7:45 PM, after reports of a horrific explosion occurred. While others are to believe this was intentional on the Pizza Shops behalf, further investigation was prompted and the explosion was originated from the pizza oven, possibly due to a <em>gas leak</em>. Firefighters and emergency responders were quick to arrive on the scene, extinguishing the fire and securing the building. Sadly, two individuals, one of whom was a staff member and the other a customer, were pronounced dead at the scene.
